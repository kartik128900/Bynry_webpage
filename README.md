This is a web application built with React that allows users to view a list of profiles and interactively explore their associated addresses on a map. Users can view essential information for each profile, such as name, photo, and a brief description, and click a "Summary" button to see the profile's location on an embedded Google Map. The application also includes an admin panel to manage profiles (add, edit, and delete) and supports search and filter functionalities for easy navigation. It's designed to provide a user-friendly and responsive experience across all devices.
